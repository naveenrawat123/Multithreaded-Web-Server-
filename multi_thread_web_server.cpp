//** This code creates a simple multithreaded web server that listens on port 8080 and 
//** responds with "Hello, World!" to any HTTP request. 
//*  The use of minimal STL and direct implementation of threading and networking 
//* functionalities make it more self-contained. 
// make code more verbose & good comments
